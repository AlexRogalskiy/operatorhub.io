          <p>
            If you have an Operator you would like to contribute to OperatorHub.io, feel free to create a pull request
            against the above directory. Please read&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorsRepoBeforePR} text="submitting your operator" />

            The easiest way to package your Operator for OperatorHub.io is to build it with the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorSdk} text="Operator SDK" />, however it is
            not a requirement. To publish your Operator, it must be built as a binary within a container, and that
            container must be hosted on a publicly accessible&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorRegistry} text="registry" />. The Operator should be&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorsRepoRequirements} text="packaged" /> so it can be deployed using the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" /> in
            addition to rendering the Operator’s detail page on OperatorHub.io.

            Your Operator should be able to be managed by the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" /> (OLM).
            This component of the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.gettingStarted} text="Operator Framework" /> is
            deployed on your Kubernetes cluster and will be able to install the Operator via CLI or through a GUI
            component like embedded OperatorHub in OpenShift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Operator submission can be formatted either following the <b><code>packagemanifest</code></b> or the
            newer <b><code>bundle</code></b> format. The former allows to ship your entire Operator with all its versions in
            one single directory. The latter allows shipping individual releases in container images. Both are supported
            but mixing of formats within a single Operator is not allowed. You need to decide for one or the other
            for your entire Operator listing. If you are new to this or you don't have this format yet, refer to our&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorsRepoRequirements} text="contribution documentation" />.
          </p>
          <h3>ClusterServiceVersion</h3>
          <p>
            The bulk of your Operator's catalog metadata will reside in a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) file, of which there
            is one per version of your Operator. This file contains the specifications of how to deploy your Operator,
            and information on which CRDs it owns and those it depends on from other Operators. In addition this is
            where you put a description, logo, version, maturity level, authoring info, links etc. for your Operator.
            This information will be used to render the detail page on OperatorHub.io.

          <p>
          </p>
          <h3>CustomResourceDefinitions</h3>
          <p>
            These should already exist if your Operator watches CRDs. Place each CRD that your Operator owns in it’s own
            YAML file. CRDs that your Operator does not own but watches are handled by OLMs dependency management.
          </p>
          <h3>PackageManifest Format</h3>
          <p>
            The <b><code>packagemanifest</code></b> is a simple list of channels that point to a particular CSV name. This allows OLM to
            serve the Operator from multiple channels, each named to convey that CSV versions' stability and update
            frequency, e.g. stable and alpha. Your package manifest must have at least one channel. For reference, use
            one of the examples in the&nbsp;

          <h3>Bundle Format</h3>
          <p>
            Alternatively you can use the <b><code>bundle</code></b> format, which is nowadays also the default of the Operator-SDK.
            The <b><code>bundle</code></b> format has a top-level directory named after your Operator name in the CSV.
            Inside are sub-directories for the individual bundle, named after the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.semanticVersioning} text="semantic versioning" />&nbsp;release of your Operator.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h3>Moving from PackageManifest to Bundle Format</h3>
          <p>
            Eventually this repository will only accept <b><code>bundle</code></b> format at some point in the future.
          Also the <b><code>bundle</code></b> format has more features like <b><code>semver</code></b> mode or, in the future,
          installing bundles directly outside of a catalog.
          </p>
          <p>Migration of existing content, irregardless of whether the Operator was created with the SDK, can be achieved
            with the <b><code>opm</code></b> tool on per Operator version basis. Checkout more details in how to&nbsp;

            A large part of the information gathered in the CSV is used for user-friendly visualization on OperatorHub.io
            or components like the embedded OperatorHub in OpenShift. Your work is on display, so please ensure to provide
            relevant information in your Operator's description, specifically covering:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What the managed application is about and where to find more information</li>
              <li>The features your Operator and how to use it</li>
              <li>Any manual steps required to fulfill pre-requisites for running / installing your Operator</li>

          <p>
            If you are developing your Operator with the Operator SDK you can leverage its packaging tooling to create
            a <b><code>bundle</code></b> by running the following command:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>$ make bundle</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The command will create the following bundle artifacts:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>a manifests directory (<b><code>bundle/manifests</code></b>) containing a CSV and all CRDs from config/crds</li>
              <li>a&nbsp;
              <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.bundleAnnotations} text="metadata" />&nbsp;directory
              (<b><code>bundle/metadata</code></b>), and&nbsp;
              <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.bundleDockerfile} text="bundle.Dockerfile" />&nbsp;
               have been created in the Operator project. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            This will scaffold a CSV on version <b><code>x.y.z</code></b>, which is set in the project <b><code>Makefile</code></b>
