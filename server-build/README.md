Build step connects to Operator registry image running on port **50051** and pulls all data required to build operators index for use with OperatorHub.io.

Built index is present in folder ./cache/operators.json as JSON file.

Utility is written in Typescript.

# Running 
`npm install` - installs all the dependencies
`npm start` - converts TS files into JS and builds JSON index

# PROTO file update
Proto files are generated by maintainers, therefore when Operator Registry instance is updated and PROTO file get changed, new proto files has to be generated.

This could be automated, but PROTO file inside registry should be stable therefore its very rare occasion.

1. copy PROTO file from checked out operator registry
`[operator-registry]\pkg\api`
2. run generator `npm run gents`
3. run build `npm start`
